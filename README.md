# Parkinson-s-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project develops a machine learning model to predict Parkinson's disease based on vocal measurements. It includes data loading, preprocessing (shuffling, splitting, standardizing, handling imbalance), training with ensemble methods, and evaluation using key metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
